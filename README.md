# chrony
Network Time Protocol Server Container

## Dependencies

To build the chrony container, some components are required that aren't in the
Base Runtime image.

### Build Dependencies

* pps-tools

## How to build the container

```
docker build --tag=chrony .
```

## How to use the container

The chrony server uses a config file (/etc/chrony.conf:) on the host, this file needs to be created first.
Example contents of /etc/chrony.conf, see 'man chrony.conf' for more options:
```
server 127.127.8.0 mode 2 # local radio clock
server 127.127.1.0 # local clock
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 12 # local fallback clock
```

Command for running chrony docker container:
```
docker run --net=host --cap-add SYS_TIME -v /etc/chrony.conf:/etc/ntp.conf:ro -d $(IMAGE_NAME)
```

## How to test the chrony server


Commands for testing chrony docker container:

```
ntpq -c "host localhost -pn
```

replace localhost with container IP if required


## Running on OpenShift 
This container requires root in order to run chronyd as chronyd checks for the user ID.
It also requires the SYS_TIME capability.
The required steps are:
```
oadm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
oc edit scc anyuid
```
An editor terminal will open after the last command.
Search for
```
allowedCapabilities: null
```
and replace it with
```
allowedCapabilities:
- SYS_TIME
```
and
```
defaultAddCapabilities: null
```
with
```
defaultAddCapabilities:
- SYS_TIME
```
Save and exit the editor and then deploy the container.
